# PersonalProjects
Repo for personal projects based off new technology I want to learn/am learning now
This repo is simply a navigation tool for my various personal projects. Each project will have its own project(s) that will have both the github repo & if applicable the download link/website for the project
## Process for choosing projects
It's as simple as going down the list & choosing a technology to work on ( noted as the starred ( * ) project ) and a corresponding project.
If I cannot think of a project I will utilize my own instance of GPT4 w/ some custom instructions to find one for me using this prompt
`Give me difficult project Ideas to gain an indepth understanding of technology_here, In doing so make sure the project is applicable to one of my hobbies or open up opportunity to add a new hobby. Explain the features, the technologies to use, and how exactly this project teaches me the technology in question`

Each tech will have a little blurb on why I wanted to learn it, the link to the project ( if completed ) & the project itself.

The hoping is that I'll both improve my coding knowhow, begin or improve upon a hobby I'm doing/wanting to do, and have fun building things in my free time.
